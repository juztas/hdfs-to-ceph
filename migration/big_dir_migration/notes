1. Did you cleaned everything unneeded under  /store/user?
    if yes - go to step 2, if no - ask to clean;

2. Admin disables write access for user on HDFS:
   cd /mnt/hadoop/store/user/
   chown -R nobody:nobody jbalcas/
   chmod -R 755 jbalcas/

3. Create proxy:
voms-proxy-init -voms cms --valid 192:00 -cert ~/.globus/usercert.pem -key ~/.globus/userkey.pem -rfc
voms-proxy-info -all

4. Ask user to test gfal stageout to his user's directory.
fallocate -l 1M /tmp/test-migr-$USER
gfal-copy /tmp/test-migr-$USER gsiftp://transfer-lb.ultralight.org/storage/cms/store/user/$USER/test-migr-$USER

5. Start migration:
Because of too many files, migration will have to be done in slow submission mode:
mkdir ~/MIGRATION/
cd ~/MIGRATION/
touch allCeph
hdfs dfs -ls -R /store/user/$USER/ &> allHdfs
cp /storage/af/other/MIGRATION/big_dir_migration/find_diff.py .
mkdir missing/
python find_diff.py &> missing/missing
cd missing;
head -10 missing;
cat missing | wc -l
split -l 10000 missing newtransfers
ls -laht
cat newtransfersaa | wc -l
head -10 newtransfersaa
rm -f missing
cd ~/MIGRATION/
cp /storage/af/other/MIGRATION/big_dir_migration/migrator.py .
screen
python migrator.py /storage/af/user/$USER/MIGRATION/missing/
Ctrl + A + D

# For admin to get a full dump of Ceph FS Files for particular user/group
find /storage/cms/store/user/jbalcas/ -type f -printf '%p\t%s\n' | cut -c 13- &> allCeph
cat allCeph | sort &> ceph_sorted
# Same command but to get dump from hdfs
find /mnt/hadoop/store/user/jbalcas/ -type f -printf '%p\t%s\n' | cut -c 12- &> allHdfs
cat allHdfs | sort &> hdfs_sorted

To compare files on hdfs with files on ceph:
rsync --progress -rvnc /mnt/hadoop/store/user/jbalcas/ root@transfer-10:/storage/cms/store/user/jbalcas/

To overwrite all files from hdfs on ceph which are different:
rsync --progress -a /mnt/hadoop/store/user/jbalcas/ root@transfer-10:/storage/cms/store/user/jbalcas/

To split rsync and speed up:
for d in /mnt/hadoop/store/group/phys_exotica/jmao/*; do echo rsync --progress -a "$d" root@transfer-10:/storage/cms/store/group/phys_exotica/jmao/; done
# Need to replce hostname and add & at the end;
